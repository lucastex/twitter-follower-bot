A simple groovy script to search users that are talking about something and follow them.

Just open Config.groovy and replace your username, password and the queries you'll search for.

To run, you'll have to have groovy installed and configured on your machine and type:

groovy -cp "lib/twitter4j-core-2.1.2.jar" TwitterFollowerBot.groovy
